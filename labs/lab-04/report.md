# Why A License
Without one, users are technically and legally not allowed to modify or use your code because with out, your code is under exclusive copyright. You can also put certain restrictions on your software you may want users to abide by, such as the GPL copyleft restrictions on derivative software needing to be also free.
# Avoiding Unlicensed Code
As stated before, if code or a project is unlicensed, you do not have the legal right to modify or distribute the code. If you do so, you run the risk of being subjected to takedowns or litigation. So avoid them, or maybe ask the authors to put an open source license.
# Gopher vs Web
Yes, I think the claim makes a lot of sense. The developers of Gopher closed off development from other users unlike the web and burdened themselves with figure out the right model. They also tried to monetize the service by having users pay a licensing fee for certain domains, which turned people away. They also chose not to follow internet standards as well the Web did.
# Why This License
Android uses Apache License, which is a permissive license and allows users to modify and use the code, but the only restriction being that they apply the license to all unmodified parts. Any modified or new parts can be licensed differently. I think this makes a lot of sense for this project because it was acquired by Google [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20110205190729/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm), and most popular phones that run android include proprietary services and programs made by Google, like the [GMS](https://www.android.com/gms/). This allows Android to still be open source but for other companies, especially Google, to monetize other parts and make them proprietary and closed source
