## How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
### Suggestion 1: Actually read and understand the error message
I had a pretty bad habit starting out of immediately looking up the error message when I didn't recognize it as something I've seen before. And then I realize that the error would've been easy to fix if I just took a few more seconds and digest the error message was actually saying.
### Suggestion 2: Really try to solve the problem first 
I feel that asking should be a last resort after you've seemingly tried everything you could think of.
## Free Culture
I thought this was pretty informative piece. I had heard of a RPI student getting in trouble for piracy but didn't actually know that how he actually went about it. Now I know that while he wasnâ€™t actually actively encouraging piracy to happen, his search engine system was abused by other users which resulted in the RIAA suing him. However, I do feel that the lawsuit was pretty unjust and kind of scummy on the part of the RIAA. But I feel perhaps maybe he should have put some sort of moderation with his engine, though that would be very difficult to do and might not help much. I think this kind of shows the double-edged sword of making stuff available to people. You can have people do cool things with it and make new innovations, but also get people who will use it to do bad. This could happen with open source projects as well, so I think this maybe be something to keep in mind for project managers whether or not they should make their projects open source.

I think a cool open source project to evaluate would be [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), an open source ML platform. It is pretty popular and well known within the machine learning community and helps researchers and other users easily set up ML for their purposes. They provide many common functions and methods to accomplsih this. I think it would be really interesting to look at how they manage such a big project and also some of the technology it uses. This includes stuff like CUDA GPU support and optimizes math for ML purposes. As for starting project of my own, I think I would want to make something web-based. I'm thinking maybe I could make a multiplayer game or something, but I want to focus on something with web development because I haven't done anything like that ever before. I will probably use something like Node or React, but I would need to investigate further.
